#include <iostream> 
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // cout is the print statement unlike print in C. You then need 2 less than signs
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
// after a function is done, we then compile (just like C).
// I can also type g++ -o runProgram helloworld.cpp
// then just type ./runProgram to run the helloworld.cpp file (it is pretty much the same as C)


// *Every time I change the file, I must recompile for the changes to be made*
// Bash is easier to use than windows powershell just like C :(
